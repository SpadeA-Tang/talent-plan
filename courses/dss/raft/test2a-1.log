test_reelection_2a

按照下面的log
第一个leader为node2，竞选成功后将其disconnect
这个时候node0会被选为leader，然后可以connect node2
然后disconnect node0和node1
这个时候检查node2是不是leader

该测试失败的原因在于在处理heartbeat的时候没有将state置为follower
但是很多时候，还是会成功，原因在于 node 2发起compaign时，会成为candidate

[2] becomes candidate at term 1
[0] grant vote for 2 at term 0
[1] grant vote for 2 at term 0
[0] becomes follower at term 1
[1] becomes follower at term 1
[2] received vote from 0 at term 1
[2] becomes leader at term 1
disconnect(2)
[0] becomes candidate at term 2
[1] grant vote for 0 at term 1
[1] becomes follower at term 2
[0] received vote from 1 at term 2
[0] becomes leader at term 2
connect(2)
disconnect(0)
disconnect(1)
[1] becomes candidate at term 3
[1] becomes follower at term 3
